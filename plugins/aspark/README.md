> **An agile AI product team for Claude Code.**
> One person plus aSPARK works like a whole team: a Product Owner who challenges your idea, a Designer who spots bad design, an Engineering Manager who locks the architecture, a Reviewer who finds your bugs, a QA Tester who clicks through your app in a real browser, and a Release Manager who ships it.

aSPARK turns Claude Code from a coding copilot into a **gated delivery process**. Every feature travels through five phases — **S**pecify, **P**lan, **A**ct, **R**eview, **K**eep — and may only move forward when the previous phase's quality gate is green.

## The SPARK Loop

<div align="center">

    <img src="assets/aspark-loop.png" alt="The SPARK loop: Specify → Plan → Act → Review → Keep, with feedback loops" width="720" />
  </picture>
</div>

| Phase | What happens | Gate to pass |
|---|---|---|
| **S**pecify | The idea is challenged, turned into user stories with acceptance criteria, and design-checked. | Spec approved: stories are testable, design risks named. |
| **P**lan | Architecture is decided, the work is cut into ordered tasks. | Plan approved: every task maps to a story, risks addressed. |
| **A**ct | The increment is built — strictly following the plan. | All planned tasks done, project builds and tests pass. |
| **R**eview | Code review by a senior eye, then hands-on QA in a real browser against the acceptance criteria. | No blocking findings, all acceptance criteria verified. |
| **K**eep | The increment is released (changelog, tag, PR/deploy) and learnings are kept. | Released and documented. |

---

## Meet the Team

| Command | Role | What they do |
|---|---|---|
| `/story-time` | 🧭 **Product Owner** | Interrogates your idea with hard questions — no yes-man. Writes user stories with acceptance criteria into `spec.md`. |
| `/look-and-feel` | 🎨 **Designer** | Detects bad design: usability heuristics, visual consistency, accessibility. Adds a design section to the spec. |
| `/sprint-plan` | 🏗️ **Engineering Manager** | Locks the architecture, makes the technical decisions, cuts the work into an ordered task breakdown in `plan.md`. |
| `/increment` | 💻 **Developer** | Builds a potentially shippable increment — strictly following the plan, no scope creep. |
| `/peer-review` | 🔍 **Reviewer** | Reviews the diff with a staff-engineer eye and writes findings into `review.md`. |
| `/demo-day` | 🧪 **QA Tester** | Clicks through the running app **in a real browser**, verifies every acceptance criterion, files bugs in `qa.md`. |
| `/go-live` | 🚀 **Release Manager** | Final checks, changelog, version tag, PR/deploy. Blocked while QA has open blockers. |
| `/spark` | 🤹 **Orchestrator** | Runs the whole loop end-to-end, enforcing every gate on the way. |

## How It Works

aSPARK keeps all decision artifacts **inside your project**, so the process is transparent and reviewable — just like a real team's ticket trail.

For each feature, a working directory is created:

```
your-project/
└── .spark/
    └── <feature-name>/
        ├── spec.md       ← written by /story-time (+ /look-and-feel)
        ├── plan.md       ← written by /sprint-plan
        ├── review.md     ← written by /peer-review
        ├── qa.md         ← written by /demo-day
        └── release.md    ← written by /go-live
```

Each phase **reads the artifact of the previous phase** and refuses to start if the gate isn't met. Example: `/go-live` will not release while `qa.md` lists open blocking bugs — it sends you back to `/increment` instead. That's the whole point: the team doesn't just produce code, it makes sure **the product actually works**.

## Installation

**Requirements:** [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and Git. For `/demo-day` you additionally need a browser integration (Claude in Chrome, or a Playwright / Chrome DevTools MCP server).

### The easy way — inside an interactive Claude Code session (recommended)

Do this in a **normal** (interactive) `claude` terminal session, using the built-in `/plugin` command. Dummy-proof version:

**1. Open Claude Code** in your terminal:

```
claude
```

**2. Add the marketplace** (the "shop" where the plugin lives — you only ever do this once):

```
/plugin marketplace add a-lottes/aSPARK
```

**3. Install the plugin** — read it as `pluginname@marketplacename`:

```
/plugin install aspark@aspark
```

**4. Restart Claude Code** — close and reopen your session (or `/exit`, then `claude` again). Plugins only activate after a restart.

**5. Check it worked:**

```
/plugin
```

This opens a menu of your installed plugins — you should see **aspark** listed and enabled.

### The non-interactive way — from a plain terminal

The `/plugin` menu command only works in an interactive session. In scripts, CI, or a non-interactive shell, use the full CLI equivalents — they do exactly the same thing:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add a-lottes/aSPARK
claude plugin install aspark@aspark
```

### Local development install

To hack on aSPARK itself, point Claude Code at a local clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a-lottes/aSPARK.git
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/aSPARK
```

> **One-line takeaway:** in a normal terminal → `/plugin marketplace add a-lottes/aSPARK` → `/plugin install aspark@aspark` → restart. Done. ✅

## Usage

A typical feature, step by step:

```
You:     /story-time I want a dashboard where users see their weekly stats
Claude:  [PO challenges the idea, asks the hard questions, writes spec.md]

You:     /look-and-feel
Claude:  [Designer reviews the planned UI, flags design risks in spec.md]

You:     /sprint-plan
Claude:  [EM locks architecture, cuts tasks into plan.md]

You:     /increment
Claude:  [builds the increment, task by task, following plan.md]

You:     /peer-review
Claude:  [reviews the diff, writes findings, fixes what's obvious]

You:     /demo-day http://localhost:3000
Claude:  [clicks through the app in a real browser, checks every acceptance criterion]

You:     /go-live
Claude:  [changelog, tag, PR — only if all gates are green]
```

In a hurry? Run the whole loop with one command:

```
You:     /spark I want a dashboard where users see their weekly stats
```

`/spark` pauses at each gate and shows you the artifact before moving on — you stay the decision maker.

## How to Read This Toolbox

If you're new to Claude Code plugins, this is all there is to it:

- **`agents/`** — the team members. Each file defines one persona (a *subagent*): its mindset, its standards, and which tools it may use. Agents are the "who".
- **`skills/`** — the ceremonies. Each folder holds one slash command (`SKILL.md`): what to do, which agent to involve, which template to fill, and which gate to enforce. Skills are the "how".
- **`templates/`** — the artifacts. Blueprints for `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `review.md`, `qa.md` and `release.md`, each ending in an explicit gate checklist. Templates are the "what".
- **`docs/`** — deep-dives, starting with the workflow and gate hand-over rules.
- **`.claude-plugin/`** — plugin metadata so Claude Code can discover and install all of the above.

Reading order for newcomers: this README → `docs/workflow.md` → one template → one skill → one agent. After that you'll understand every file in the repo.
